For the final project, I worked on implementing part of a Q-Learning algorithm to train a 'Pirate' agent to find a path through a small maze to get to the 'Treasure' (finish line). I was tasked with creating the main epoch loop, which is what the agent is trained on over a thousand iterations. I was given the code that creates the 8x8 maze,
